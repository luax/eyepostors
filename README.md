Eyepostors
===========

Rendering large amounts of real-time characters or crowds in virtual environments can be very costly in terms of processing power, leading to a drop in frame rate for software that uses them.

This project aimed to design an impostor system in the game engine Unity that utilises Tobii’s eye tracking.

One of the main features of implementing impostors is the performance gain as they are cheap to calculate and
render. What we wanted to do besides using eye tracking technology is to also maximise the numbers of virtual characters used in a scene.

To do this, several features were needed:
* Virtual characters with several different levels of detail (LOD).
* Animation and movement for the virtual characters.
* A 3D environment of a city block.
* Scripts to switch between different levels of quality.
* Scripts to handle and utilise the eye tracker’s data.
